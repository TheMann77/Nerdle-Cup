# Nerdle-Cup
An online multiplayer version of the viral game Nerdle.

I'm not allowed to have the front-end code in a public repository, but you can see it in action at https://cup.nerdlegame.com/cup/home/

## Technologies
- I built an API in Python using Flask
- I used Heroku Postgres SQL to store and retrieve game data
- I used ReactJS to build the front-end to the app
